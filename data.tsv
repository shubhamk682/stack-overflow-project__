android studio emulator: WARNING: Increasing RAM size to 1024MB <p>I am trying to build my first android application in Android Studio, following the tutorial <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html</a>, using AndroidStudio 2.1.2. </p>  <p>Whenever I run the emulator, I get this error message:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Android Emulator could not allocate 1.0 GB of memory for the current AVD configuration. Consider adjusting the RAM size of your AVD in the AVD Manager.   Error detail: QEMU 'pc.ram': Cannot allocate memory</p> </blockquote>  <p>Decreasing the size of the memory on the Nexus5x emulator has no effect, so the error message still says "could not allocate 1.0 GB", even when I adjust the memory of the AVD to 256MB. The app needs to run on Android 6.0, with a Nexus5x emulator, so I can't try with a different emulator. Any help would be much appreciated :)</p>
<p>The problem is that you're trying to encode the whole URL. The only pieces you want to encode are the querystring <em>values</em>, and you can just use <code>Url.Encode()</code> for this.</p>  <p>You don't want to encode the address, the querystring params, or the <code>?</code> and <code>&amp;</code> delimiters, otherwise you'll end up with an address the browser can't parse.</p>  <p>Ultimately, it would look something like this:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;a href="https://www.notmysite.co.uk/controller/action?order_ID=@Url.Encode(Model.bookingNumber)&amp;hashComparator=@Url.Encode(Model.hashCode)"&gt;Click Here to be transferred&lt;/a&gt; </code></pre>
